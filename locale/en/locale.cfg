shortwave-radio=Set the radio channel using the large dial knob. The channel is set by all the signals in the first logistic group (including quality and number). If a Logistic Group name is set, this overrides the signals contained in the group. Using named groups, you can easily select an existing channel/group name from the list.
shortwave-port=Connect the radio to a local circuit network. Signals will be transmitted to/from other radios tuned to the same channel. Green and red wires are sent separately.
