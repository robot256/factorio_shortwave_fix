shortwave=Connect circuit networks via shortwave radio channels.

shortwave-port=Shortwave I/O

shortwave-radio=Set the radio channel using the large dial knob. Channels take the signal count into account, so IronPlate(2) is different to IronPlate(17).
shortwave-port=Connect the radio to a local circuit network. Signals will be transmitted to other radios tuned to the same channel. NOTE! If signal counts appear doubled it's because both red and green networks are transmitted. Connect port to a power pole to see red/green separation.
